	Out of concern for everyone's safety amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and as a
	preemptive measure following the closure of bars and restaurants across several
	states this afternoon, we will be temporarily closed as of today.
</p>
<p>
	Please be careful, stay home as much as possible, and wash your hands. We will see you soon.
